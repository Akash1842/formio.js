# Introduction
The Form.io Renderer library (formio.js) is a plain JavaScript form renderer, builder, and SDK for Form.io. This allows you to create JSON forms with the form builder, render those JSON schema forms within your application, as well as provides an interface SDK to communicate to the Form.io API's. The benefits of this library include.

 - Full featured, drag-and-drop JSON Form Builder
 - Plain JavaScript implementation using ES6 and Modern practices (no jQuery, Angular, React, or any other framework dependency)
 - Renders a JSON schema as a webform and hooks up that form to the Form.io API's
 - Nested components, layouts, Date/Time, Select, Input Masks, and many more included features
 - Full JavaScript API SDK library on top of Form.io
